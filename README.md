[Quantum Computer's Impact on Encryption](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-quantum-computing-threat-to-encryption/)


I took a course on quantum computing last semester - sparking my interest in 
quantum computers. The article explores how quantum computing poses a REAL threat to encryption 
standards status quo...explaining how it has the potential to break cryptographic protocols that are widely used today. Few examples are RSA, ECC, etc. The potential changes to our cybersecurity landscape could be revolutionary and it is truly exciting to think about how 
advancements like these may reshape digital security in the near (or FAR) future.
